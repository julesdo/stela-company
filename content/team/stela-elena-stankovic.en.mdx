    **Stela Elena Stankovic** — Artistic Director, Dancer, Choreographer,
    Pedagogue. Born from a dual culture (Serbia / France), Stela is marked by
    the richness of bodily and artistic languages. Trained in classical dance,
    contemporary dance, physical theatre and artistic pedagogy, she has danced
    in several companies across Europe and develops a pedagogical approach
    combining body, imagination and language.

    **La Stela Company** : Founded in 2024 with the support of La Fabrique de
    la Danse, the association develops choreographic and multidisciplinary
    creations, educational workshops for children and adults, and an
    intercultural dimension (notably with German and other languages).

    **Vision** : Create living and accessible art. Explore the link between
    language, emotion and movement. Transmit an energy that transforms the
    spectator into a partner of creation.

    **In Médée ∞ MEDEA** : Stela is both creator, performer and artistic
    director. She explores the friction of text and movement: speech bends,
    suspends, addresses. Each fragment is born from doubt, bodily intensity and
    an inner flame that never goes out.
