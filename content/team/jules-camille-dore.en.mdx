    **Jules-Camille Doré** — Musician under the name Mastercat and digital
    architect. The meeting between La Stela Company and his agency Hyppe took
    place around a common vision: to create a website that lives up to the
    creativity and sensitivity of the company.

    As a **developer and web designer**, Jules-Camille designed and developed
    this website as a true virtual stage. Each page, each animation, each
    interaction has been thought through to translate the intensity and emotion
    of La Stela Company's creations.

    His approach? Treat the web like a musical composition: each element has its
    place, each transition has its rhythm, each interaction resonates with the
    viewer's emotion. He creates bridges between live performance and the
    digital world, ensuring that the intensity of the stage is found in every
    pixel.
