  Dance and German : A winning duo for little ones and big ones !

  For 3-6 years : An introduction and awakening of the body very gently with
  songs and small choreographies, games and animal imitations to
  discover German in a playful way.

  In a fast-paced world, this workshop offers children precious time
  to feel, express themselves and grow. The body becomes the learning vector
  : we learn by moving, singing, playing. An approach
  that lays the first foundations of a conscious and
  benevolent relationship with the body, essential for the child's development.
