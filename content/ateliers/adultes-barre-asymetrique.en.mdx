  Starting from the principle that the body is intimately linked to the mind, the objective is to release tensions and gain amplitude in one's movements, to affirm one's choices by putting them into movement. It is a form of dialogue with others and with ourselves.

  The exercises allow to correct posture, to center oneself and to strengthen the abdominal muscles while loosening the joints. Based on a series of dynamic exercises, the work seeks to link the use of weight and breathing. Some more elaborate choreographic phrases are proposed in order to regain one's place, strengthen one's supports, improve one's coordination, precision and concentration. Essential elements to face various situations encountered in daily life, particularly in a professional context. It is not uncommon to gain 1 or 2 cm in posture thanks to the work done on the spine, to obtain a more graceful gait and to free the lumbar region (especially for those who work a lot sitting) – a real relief !

  Nothing is more revealing than movement – the body says what words cannot : Influenced by the work of Martha Graham or Carolyn Carlson, I wish to bring a reconnection to the body to my students, in this world that goes so fast. Take the time to feel and return to oneself. Bring solid foundations and regular maintenance to the body, our home. Everything then starts from there : Our relationships, our emotions, our language, our hopes, our decisions and our actions… – Stela Elena Stankovic
