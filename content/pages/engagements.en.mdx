      ## Artistic and Cultural Education at the heart of our mission

      La Stela Company is committed to developing Artistic and Cultural Education (EAC) projects in partnership with schools, cultural centers and institutions. Our approach combines artistic creation and educational transmission to raise awareness among young audiences about dance, theater and languages.

      ## Our EAC Actions

      ### 1. School workshops

      Regular interventions in educational institutions to raise awareness among students about contemporary dance, physical theater and body expression. Tailor-made projects adapted to school curricula.

      ### 2. Artistic encounters

      Organization of meetings between students and artists, discovery of the backstage of creation, exchanges on the creative process and professions in the performing arts.

      ### 3. Multidisciplinary projects

      Creation of projects that combine dance, theater, languages (notably German) and visual arts, promoting cultural openness and interdisciplinarity.

      ### 4. Sponsorships and residencies

      Support for young talents, artistic residencies in schools and partnerships with conservatories and art schools.

      ### 5. Body coaching in professional settings

      Interventions with executives, actors, professional dancers, theater companies, businesses and hotels. An approach that combines reconnection with the body, posture improvement and well-being at work.

      ## Why EAC ?

      Artistic and Cultural Education allows to :

      - Develop creativity and personal expression
      - Strengthen self-confidence and self-esteem
      - Promote openness to others and cultures
      - Raise awareness of artistic practice from an early age
      - Create bridges between the school world and the professional artistic world

      ## Body Coaching

      « Nothing is more revealing than movement - the body says what words cannot : Influenced by the work of Martha Graham or Carolyn Carlson, I wish to bring a reconnection to the body to my clients, in this world that goes so fast.

      Take the time to feel and return to oneself. Bring solid foundations and regular maintenance to the body, our home.

      Everything then starts from there : Our relationships, our emotions, our language, our hopes, our decisions and our actions... » — **Stela Elena Stankovic**

      ### Body coaching objectives

      Starting from the principle that the body is intimately linked to the mind, the objective is to release tensions and gain amplitude in one's movements, to affirm one's choices by putting them into movement. It is a form of dialogue with others and with ourselves.

      The exercises allow to correct posture and strengthen the abdominal muscles while gently loosening the joints. Based on a series of dynamic exercises, the work seeks to link the use of weight and breathing. Some more elaborate choreographic phrases are proposed in order to regain one's place, strengthen one's supports, improve one's coordination, precision and concentration.

      It is not uncommon to gain 1 or 2 cm in posture thanks to the work done on the spine, to obtain a more graceful gait and to free the lumbar region (especially for those who work a lot sitting) - a real relief !

      ### For whom ?

      - Executives & Executive Women
      - Actors / Professional Dancers & Theater Companies
      - Businesses & Hotels with fitness / dance room

      *(Mobility in Paris)*
