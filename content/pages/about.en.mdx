      ### La Stela Company

      Founded in 2024 with the support of La Fabrique de la Danse, the association develops choreographic and multidisciplinary creations, educational workshops for children and adults, and an intercultural dimension (notably with German and other languages).

      ### Our Vision

      Create living and accessible art. Explore the link between language, emotion and movement. Transmit an energy that transforms the spectator into a partner of creation.

      ### Our Values

      **Myth & contemporary** : revisiting ancient narratives to speak to today's world.

      **Body & language** : uniting movement, voice, music and emotions.

      **Transmission** : workshops open to children, adults, students, diverse audiences.

      **Accessibility** : creating bridges between generations and cultures.

      **Experimentation** : always searching, never fixed.
